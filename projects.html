<LI id="coin"> <STRONG> Application of Collective Intelligence concepts to Multi Agent Systems</STRONG>
    <P> This involves techniques from the emerging field of Collectives to a search problem involving multiple 
        Unmanned Air Vehicles(UAVs). The basic methodology is derived from theory of Collectives and multi-agent 
        Q learning is used for the dynamic optimization involved.</P>

<LI id="uav"> <STRONG> Design and construction of an autonomous aircraft with specified mission requirements</STRONG>
    <P> This was essentially a course project with the mission requirement of reaching a specified target.
       The fully autonomous aircraft was to be released from a height of 60,000ft and had to return to the 
       starting location using a GPS unit for guidance and no SAS. The first phase was to reach a specified 
       location when released from a height of 500ft. This is the aspect that we are currently focussing on.
       My work in particular dealt with the airfoil design and the programming for the navigation system.</P>

<LI id="pso"> <STRONG> Application of Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithms to Search Problems
                    involving multiple agents</STRONG>
    <P> The project basically compared the techniques of Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) and Genetic Algorithms(GA)
        applied to a dynamic optimization problem, involving multiple UAVs searching regions of maximum lift
        for best aerodynamic efficiency. The lift distribution continuously changed as the UAVs flew over the design
        space.</P>

<LI id="co"> <STRONG> Aerodynamic and Structural Wing Design using Collaborative Optimization</STRONG>
    <P> The concept of Collaborative Optimization was applied to wing design with the overall objective of maximizing Range.

		degree of design freedom.</P>

<LI id="ssbj"> <STRONG> Conceptual Design of a Supersonic Business Jet </STRONG>
    <P> This was a course project spread over two courses involving the conceptual design of a supersonic 
    	business jet. The preliminary design requiremnts were given and the others derived through a market
    	survey of existing aircraft. The design aspect empahsized on aerodynamic design and cabin design to
    	start with, later incorporating the stability and control, structural, and propulsion system 
    	integration aspects.</P>

<LI id="btp"> <STRONG> Aerodynamic Wing Design using Sequential Local Response Surfaces<EM>(B.Tech Project)</EM></STRONG>
    <P> This investigates the optimization strategy of Sequential Local Approximations(referred to as Multipoint 
    Approximations by Guinta et al) coupled with Response Surface Methodology. The problem chosen for the purpose is to 
    design the wing cross-section(defined by 7 parameters) for maximum L/D at cruise condition. The aircraft data belongs 
    to a typical jet fighter, and the planform parameters are those of the Onera M-6 wing. Second order polynomial response 
    surfaces in 7 variable design space, boxed by move limits, are used for the local approximation to optimize lift to drag
    ratio of the wing. Results generated using sequential local approximations indicate that it is an effective method for 
    finding the local optimum in a design space. </P>
